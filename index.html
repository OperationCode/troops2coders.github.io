      <h3>Why Troops2Coders?</h3>
      <p>The Troops2Coders mission is to assist YOU, our US military active duty or military veterans in becoming coders and writing software professionally. Our goal is to move you from unemployment or underemployment to a starting salary of at least $45,000 per year.</p>

      <h4>Does my <b>military training</b> transfer easily to software companies?</h4>
      <p>Absolutely. You live by the motto, "ductus exemplo" (lead by example), you are decisive, communicate clearly, get things done, understand that there is no "I" in team, and live for moving your team to the objective quickly and effectively. Those soft skills are exactly what software companies are hiring for, first.</p>

      <h4>Do I need a LinkedIn to get a job <b>writing code?</b></h4>
      <p>In software development, the VPs of Engineering care more that you know how to code, not where you learned it. They'll be looking more closely at your GitHub, the side projects you've built and shared with the world and a Twitter handle where you share what you know.</p>

      <h4>What can I do while I'm <b>still on active-duty</b> to start preparing for my transition?</h4>
      <p>Master Git version control (GitHub), passed <a href="http://exercism.io/">http://exercism.io/</a> in flying colors, run through <a href="http://troops2coders.com">freeCodeCamp</> projects with your eyes closed, code review and TDD everything.</p>

      <h4>What will make me most marketable and competitive in a highly competitive employment marketplace?</h4>
      <p>See above. Also, attend as many software conferences with your open source software peers as you can and they should know you by first name basis.</p>

      <h4>Will my New GI Bill pay for code school?</h4>
      <p>Yes, some code schools are already VA approved for New GI Bill benefits.</p>

      <h4>Is there a <b>qualified code school</b> that accepts military education benefits where I am stationed or near where I want to live?</h4>
      <p>The northwest has one coming online fall 2016, as does Los Angeles. The other two exist in Colorado. Operation Code's advocacy team works with participating code schools to navigate regulatory and compliance so that code schools are more accessible to US servicemembers.</p>

      <h4>What is the perfect programming language?</h4>
      <p>There is no perfect programming language, you just have to pick one that you enjoy and gets the jobs done that you need. Pick one where there are multiple open source contributors vs. just one or two. Also reference <a href="https://twitter.com/mrb_bk/status/738836245112061953">Michael Bernstein's tweet</a>, master one, then master others.</p>
