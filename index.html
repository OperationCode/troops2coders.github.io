      <h3>Why Troops2Coders?</h3>
      <p>The Troops2Coders mission is to assist YOU, our US military active duty or military veterans in becoming coders and writing software professionally. Our goal is to move you from unemployment or underemployment to a starting salary of at least $65,000 per year.</p>

      <h4>Does my <b>military training</b> transfer easily to software companies?</h4>
      <p>Absolutely. You live by the motto, "<i>ductus exemplo</i>" (lead by example), you are decisive, communicate clearly, get things done, understand that there is no "I" in team, and live for moving your team to the objective quickly and effectively. Those soft skills are exactly what software companies are hiring for, first.</p>

      <h4>Do I need a LinkedIn to get a job <b>writing code?</b></h4>
      <p>In software development, the VPs of Engineering care more that you know how to code, not where you learned it. They'll be looking more closely at your GitHub, the side projects you've built and shared with the world and a Twitter handle where you share what you know.</p>

      <h4>What can I do while I'm <b>still on active-duty</b> to start preparing for my transition?</h4>
      <p>Master Git version control (GitHub), passed <a href="http://exercism.io/">http://exercism.io/</a> in flying colors, run through <a href="http://troops2coders.com">freeCodeCamp</a> projects with your eyes closed, code review and TDD everything you can get your hands on.</p>

      <h4>What will make me most marketable and competitive in a highly competitive employment marketplace?</h4>
      <p>See above. Also, attend as many software conferences with your open source software peers as you can and they should know you by first name basis. Write and maintain a blog where you share answers to the most complex problems your facing.</p>

      <h4>Will my New GI Bill pay for code school?</h4>
      <p>Yes, some code schools are already VA approved for New GI Bill benefits. On a broader level, <a href="https://operationcode.org/">Operation Code</a>, is the leading veterans service organization working to onboard more.</p>

      <h4>Is there a <b>qualified code school</b> that accepts military education benefits where I am stationed or near where I want to live?</h4>
      <p>Many software developers are self-taught, but if you're looking for a classroom and 70+ week environment than consider code school as your post-military option. The northwest has one coming online fall 2016, as does Los Angeles. The other two exist in Colorado. <a href="https://operationcode.org/">Operation Code</a>'s advocacy team works with participating code schools to navigate regulatory and compliance so that code schools are more accessible to US servicemembers. Also, many code schools already offer <a href="https://operationcode.org/scholarships">scholarships</a> to make coding bootcamps more accessible for our troops.</p>

      <h4>What is the perfect programming language?</h4>
      <p>There is no perfect programming language, you just have to pick one that you enjoy and gets the jobs done that you need. Pick one where there are multiple open source contributors vs. just one or two. Also reference <a href="https://twitter.com/mrb_bk/status/738836245112061953">Michael Bernstein's tweet</a>, master one, then master others.</p>

      <h4>What is GitHub and why do you guys preach it?</h4>
      <p>GitHub is the greatest repository of open source software in the world where software developers can share their work and anyone else can access it, evaluate, test it and build upon it. As a software developer, nine out of ten times you'll
      be using GitHub and so it's important that you master Git version control workflow just like you mastered how to use your computer keyboard.</p>

      <h4>What is Slack, and is that your office?</h4>
      <p>Yes. Slack is also an real-time app used by 10s of thousands of startups, organizations and groups to get on the same sheet of music quickly and efficiently. When you sign up, you'll get an invite to our private Slack where you'll quickly become part of the largest military veterans coding community in the world. At it's core, Slack is what we use to code review on Ruby, Python, JavaScript, et and coordinate, integrate and synchronize efforts.</p>
